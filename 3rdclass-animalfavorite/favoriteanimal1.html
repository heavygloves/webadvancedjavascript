					<p>i have discovered that a new thing about falcons: they prey on other birds that are smaller than themselves. what a battle. very fighter plane status. very top gun. not so much into this. why did i think that i like falcons? i suppose for the fact that they move swiftly in the air and was the first thing that came to mind. </p>
